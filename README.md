# hapi-boilerplate
A hapi boilerplate created from scratch, based on several popular existing boilerplates, for the purpose of learning structure and hapi fundamentals.

This boilerplate was built referencing the following other boiler plates: hapi-ninja (by poetic-ninja), aqua (by jedireza), nodejs-account-boilerplate (by fs-opensource), and mullet (by lynnaloo).

Folder structure, practices & style, and functionality were borrowed from each.
(also this article, https://medium.com/zappos-engineering/manifests-plugins-and-schemas-organizing-your-hapi-application-68cf316730ef)

Instead of forking and copying much of the source, this project was assembled from scratch to gain understanding of each piece individually, as well as what components are fundamental to common robust web servers.

### Node boilerplates referenced
* hapi-ninja
* fs-accounts
* aqua
* mullet

## Coding Style 
Please note, in this project I am not following any particular documented coding style, but habits I have acquired over time (many from my days with C).

I do however feel readable code and consistent style are very important. And, am open to following any team's predefined style.
* One such example, http://hapijs.com/styleguide

## Goals
At the onset, some goals in mind were to gain experience with the following components:
* Hapi
    - named routes
* Handlebars
* Bootstrap
* Locale
* Config (port ?)
* Testing (Lab)
* Gulp 

## Tasks using Gulp
* jslint
* ...

## Notes
* npm start & directory structure
    - I opted with creating an executeable bin/www, matching a technique I've seen used with some express examples (and pointed out by a Code School instructor, also commonly used by developers at NodeJS)
    - One reason I liked this, is because it the server class definition and creation in one file (server.js), and the launching or exection in another file. Seemed like a sensible separation of concerns.

## Components / Practices to use and/or consider
* good, good-console
* hapi-named-routes
* lab
* gulp (or grunt)
* directory structure (best practices)
* i18n ?, locale (internationalization)
* TBD code style - http://hapijs.com/styleguide 

## How'd I do? (my perspective, a self critique...)
* directory structure: ended up with something that made sense, but not sure how standard
* coding style, like to think I kept it neat, but know I need to be more consistent. I do strongly believe neat/readable code is extremely important. And willing to follow any agreed upon coding style.

## Micro blog
* found it challenging to sort out / choose a project folder structure. Saw several examples. Some were simple, some were more complex. It was difficult to in some cases to ascertain what the advantages are of the various structures. That is where experience comes in to play. Ultimately, I will settle on something simple for now, which seems neat and organized. I likely over thought this at this stage of the game (which did cost me some time)
